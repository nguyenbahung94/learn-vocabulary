I have a test tomorrow.
I like to study with my friend Sarah.
She is very smart.
We meet at the library.
But it is too crowded.
There aren't any empty tables.
We go to Sarah's house.
But it's too noisy.
Her brother is having a piano lesson.
Finally, we go to my house.
There aren't any people at my house.
It is quiet and we can study.
I want to get a good grade on the test.
