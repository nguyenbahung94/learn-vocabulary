There is no school today.
It is snowing too much.
I want to go outside to play.
I have to put on a warm hat, a coat, and gloves.
My neighbors are playing in the snow.
They are building a snowman.
I help finish the snowman.
Then we have a snowball fight.
Now we are cold so we go inside.
We sit by the fireplace and drink hot chocolate.
It is still snowing outside.
