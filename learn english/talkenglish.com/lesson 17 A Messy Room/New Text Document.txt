I have to clean my room.
There are dirty clothes on the floor.
There are clean clothes on my bed.
There are books and trash everywhere.
I put the dirty clothes in the laundry basket.
I fold the clean clothes.
I put them in the dresser.
I put the books on my desk.
I put the trash in the trash can.
I sweep the floor.
Now my room is not messy.
