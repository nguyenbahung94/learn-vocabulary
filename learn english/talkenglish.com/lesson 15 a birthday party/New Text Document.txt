Today is my roommate's birthday.
We have many things to do before the party.
We have to clean the living room and kitchen.
Then we have to go shopping.
I also have to wrap his present.
It's a new baseball glove.
He likes to play baseball.
Our friends arrive at 7 o'clock.
We eat cake and drink soda.
We listen to music and dance.
It is a fun party.
