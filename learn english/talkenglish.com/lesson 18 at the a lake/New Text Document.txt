In the summer, my family goes to the lake.
There are many cabins at the lake.
We rent a small cabin on the shore.
I spend a lot of time with my sisters.
We are always near the water.
There is a dock behind the cabin.
We can jump off the dock into the lake.
Or we can fish from the dock.
There is a small boat we can use.
We row out to the island.
I like to visit the lake.
