I want to do something with my friends.
But we don't know what to do.
Paul wants to see a movie.
But Jon and I don't want to stay inside.
Jon wants to play basketball.
But Paul doesn't like to play basketball.
We decide to go to the park.
We play catch with a football.
And we skate on the path around the park.
We buy hot dogs, soda, and ice cream.
Then, we relax in the sun.
