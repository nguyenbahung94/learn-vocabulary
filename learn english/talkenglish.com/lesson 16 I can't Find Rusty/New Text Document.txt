I have to walk my dog, Rusty, after school.
We walk to the park.
Rusty sees a squirrel.
He runs and I can't hold his leash.
Rusty chases the squirrel.
I can't catch him.
Now I have to find Rusty.
I climb a tree so I can see.
I look for Rusty.
He is near the playground.
I run across the field and get him.
Now we can go home.
